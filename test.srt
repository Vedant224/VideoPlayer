Thank you for such
a wonderful introduction.

3
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:08,908
Great.

4
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:11,074
I'm here today to talk about motivation,

5
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:13,745
and I've learned
in my few years on this earth

6
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,856
that motivation is really the key

7
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:18,122
to effecting change
in anything that you do.

8
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:21,723
You can put a paper that was written
without motivation, without any effort,

9
00:00:21,723 --> 00:00:24,101
and a paper that was written
with drive and passion

10
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:25,341
next to each other;

11
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:27,007
it's clear which one is the winner.

12
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:29,514
Motivation is the underlying factor,

13
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:32,845
I believe, in everything
that we do on a daily basis.

14
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:35,430
If you don't have motivation
in something that you do,

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,655
then you really can't achieve
what it is that you want to achieve.

16
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:42,131
Everyone has motivation for things
they're passionate about,

17
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,600
things that interest you,
things that inspire you,

18
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,362
and of course you'll have motivation

19
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:49,240
if you play a sport, if you're in drama,
if you're in a band,

20
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:51,462
you'll have motivation
to accomplish that task.

21
00:00:51,462 --> 00:00:53,399
But the true test of finding motivation

22
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:56,339
is if you can find it in something
that doesn't interest you.

23
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,519
Personally, I'm interested
in sitting through town council meetings

24
00:00:59,535 --> 00:01:02,250
and reading the 404-page
town of Barnstable budget.

25
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:05,982
But others might not find
so much paper so interesting.

26
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:11,293
However, motivation can be found
in everything that you do.

27
00:01:11,556 --> 00:01:14,370
I like to look at it,
in terms of finding motivation,

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,255
as just putting yourself
in someone else's shoes.

29
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:20,176
When you're questioning,
"Why do I have to do this?

30
00:01:20,232 --> 00:01:22,723
Why do I have to put in
the time and the effort?"

31
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,825
you can just look at what you're doing

32
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,264
and say, "This helps
this person because ... "

33
00:01:27,264 --> 00:01:29,087
or "This person is going to appreciate

34
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:31,650
my effort and my motivation
on this task because ... "

35
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,831
And I've always found
that that appreciation

36
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:36,554
that others have
for the effort that you put in,

37
00:01:36,604 --> 00:01:38,221
that's what motivates me,

38
00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:40,864
the fact that someone
is going to appreciate what I did.

39
00:01:40,907 --> 00:01:44,033
So when the teacher gives
you a paper or something to do,

40
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:46,720
and you say, "This is stupid.
I have better things to do.

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,009
I'd much rather go outside
and throw a football."

42
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,045
Whatever it is,

43
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:54,832
look at it and say, "This person
is going to appreciate the work.

44
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,445
This person put in the effort
to create the assignment.

45
00:01:57,445 --> 00:01:59,659
Now they're going to see it
and appreciate it."

46
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:01,910
I do that in every assignment I'm given

47
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,511
and everything that is ever
brought before me.

48
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:07,852
And that's always something
that I think we need to go out and look at

49
00:02:07,852 --> 00:02:10,026
when we go out to tackle an issue.

50
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,474
Filing papers - people
might not find it interesting.

51
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:16,278
But think about how much help
you're doing to somebody else.

52
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:19,654
Think about the responsibility
that you're helping someone else fulfill.

53
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:22,735
And that sort of help
and appreciation motivates you.

54
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,874
For me, fine dressing is something
that I like to do every single day,

55
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:31,882
and I don't just do it because I enjoy it;
I do it because people appreciate it.

56
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,972
People see that I took the extra time

57
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:36,513
to prepare myself
for whatever it is that I'm doing,

58
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:39,853
and they thank me for it,
and that thanks, that appreciation,

59
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:41,600
is truly what motivates me to go out

60
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,712
and do whatever
it is that is put before me.

61
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:45,698
So I want to finish briefly

62
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:50,669
just by saying that motivation
is so important in anything that you do,

63
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:53,592
and without it, you really
can't accomplish what you want,

64
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:56,013
but with it, you have
the passion to effect change,

65
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:57,583
the passion to make a difference,

66
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,200
and you really do have the passion

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,406
to go out and change
the way things are done

68
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:03,929
and make a difference
in anything that you want to do.

69
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:05,743
Thank you for your time and your ears.

70
00:03:05,743 --> 00:03:07,064
(Applause)
